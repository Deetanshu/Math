# Math
The implementations of various things that I did over time. While I've typed out all the code myself, in the earlier files I've followed tutorials or blog posts, but I ensured that I understood what I'd done.

* Logistic_regression.py - Logistic regression model.
* RNN.py - Recurrent Neural Network.
* Random_forest.py - A Random Forest model.
* VAE_Keras.py - Variational Autoencoder using Keras.
* autocomplete.py - Created an autocomplete model (model not included)
* deepdream.py - An implementation of Google's deepdream.
* k_means.py - K means clustering.
* svm.py - Support Vector Machines
